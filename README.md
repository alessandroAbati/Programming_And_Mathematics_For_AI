# Programming_And_Mathematics_For_AI

## Overview

### Task 1
In Task_1.ipynb, we develop a numpy-based multi-layer neural network. Key aspects include implementing sigmoid, ReLU, and softmax layers, inverted dropout, a customizable neural network class, gradient descent-based optimizers, and an evaluation of different network architectures and hyperparameters.

### Task 2
Task_2.ipynb focuses on building deep learning networks using PyTorch. This task includes developing a base model, implementing an improvement to the model and optimizing hyperparameters.
